Programming the new ATtiny devices from the Arduino IDE
   The procedure to program a device is as follows:

1. Make a UPDI programmer by installing ElTangas's jtag2updi program on an Arduino Uno, or other ATmega328P-based board, as described in Make UPDI Programmer.
2. Install Spence Konde's megaTinyCore in the Arduino IDE, as described in megaTinyCore Installation.
3. In the Arduino IDE select the appropriate family from the megaTinyCore section of the Boards menu, and the appropriate part from the Chip menu.
4. Select jtag2updi (megaTinyCore) from the Programmer menu.
5. Connect the Arduino Uno (or equivalent) to the chip you're programming, select its USB port from the Port menu, and select Upload.
